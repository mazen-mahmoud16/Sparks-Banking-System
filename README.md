# Sparks-Banking-System
Here is the final task of the Sparks Foundation Internship, where I choose task 1 to develop. Where it was a banking system where I can transfer money from user to another and show all the transactions

## To access the website you can enter the following url: https://transactions-website.000webhostapp.com/

## This code will not work unless you host it to webhost000, or change the config file to your local database, but then you need to enter any fake users and make table transactions.
